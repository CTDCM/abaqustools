 ***WARNING: For 282 beam elements either the average curvature about the local 
             1-direction differs by more than 0.1 degrees per unit length as 
             compared to the default curvature or the approximate integrated 
             curvature for the entire beam differs by more than 5 degrees as 
             compared to the approximate integrated default curvature. This may 
             be due to a user-specified normal or due to the nodal averaging 
             routine used by Abaqus. This difference may cause unexpected 
             behavior of the beam and you may want to verify that the beam 
             normals are correct for your problem. The elements have been 
             identified in element set WarnBeamCurvature1.

 ***WARNING: For 172 beam elements either the average curvature about the beam
